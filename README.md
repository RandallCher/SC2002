MOBLIMA is an application to computerize the processes of making online booking and purchase of movie tickets, listing of movies and sale reporting. It will be used by the moviegoers and cinema staff. The application acts as a centralized ‘location’ for making bookings for all the Cineplex’s in different locations managed by the vendor.

The design considerations, principles and use of object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts can be found in the full report 'ssp2-Group2 Report.pdf'. The report also includes a detailed explanation of the design considerations as well as some possible enhancements and a UML Class Diagram for the MOBLIMA
